# Pantheon GPU Miner Research

## Description

 Upgrade Pantheon's mining capabilities to include GPU mining.

## Research Criteria

The research should:
1. Identify mining software to be supported
2. Identify Protocols to be supported
3. Implementation instructions of those protocols


## Research Procedure


## Research Documentation

### Current Pantheon Releases

Currently, Pantheon [offers binaries](https://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/latest/Installation/Install-Binaries/) for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. As such, it would be ideal for a GPU miner integration to include compatibility across these three operating systems.

Pantheon, as of now, is a Command Line Interface (CLI) solution, and such, design a user interface is not within the scope of the project. However, as a CLI application, flags must be included to perform various operations.






### Mining Software


Ethereum mining software includes the following:

- [ETHminer](https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer)
- [Claymore](https://github.com/Claymore-Dual/Claymore-Dual-Miner)
- [CGMiner]()
- [WinETH]()
- [Minergate]()
